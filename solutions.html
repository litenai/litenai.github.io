              One of our clients hosts extensive network traffic data in the cloud, reaching volumes that can span into petabytes
              becoming cost prohibitive. LitenAI offers a big data solution capable of storing limitless log data. It employs
              industry-standard open data lake format delta-lake for data storage. Specifically, in this scenario, data is stored
              in partitions categorized by traffic timestamps.

              To address company needs and inquiries, they regularly query these files to detect policy violations. However, this
              process became notably slow, hindering their ability to meet service level requirements. To tackle this, LitenAI
              incorporates an acceleration layer by storing data in a tensor-formatted file. This diminishes the necessity for
              cross-referencing and joining with additional data dimensions. As a result, Liten expedited the customer's query,
              delivering the sought-after policy answers promptly.

            <p class="text-lightgray description">
              The Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) sets industry-standard benchmarks for data and query performance.
              TPC BenchmarkTM H is a decision support benchmark. Benchmark tests are conducted for Query 5 and Query 6 of TPCH because
              they have complex joins and result in longer query plans. These tests involved utilizing both a standalone Spark cluster
              and a separate Liten service. Liten enhanced query performance through a tensor-based engine and preserved an in-memory
              cache of tensors to eliminate redundant creation processes.

                <p class="text-lightgray description">
                  LitenAI expedites this process by eliminating the necessity for joins. Instead, tensor data replaces joins
                  with more straightforward multi-dimensional lookups. This streamlines operations by minimizing shuffle
                  operations, resulting in a significant acceleration of the query.

                  With LitenAI, the query plan is simplified along with accelerated scan/aggregates. On a standard

                  0.06 seconds, delivering over a 100x performance improvement.
