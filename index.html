                  LitenAI expedites this process by eliminating the necessity for joins. Instead, tensor data replaces joins 
                  with more straightforward multi-dimensional lookups. This streamlines operations by minimizing shuffle 
                  operations, resulting in a significant acceleration of the query.

                  With LitenAI, the query plan is simplified along with accelerated scan/aggregates. On a standard 
                  Azure DS2 VM, Spark 3.2 required 16 seconds to execute, whereas Liten completed the task in a mere 
                  0.06 seconds, delivering over a 100x performance improvement.
