          Here are a few use cases where Liten is able to help customers solve
          big data reasoning.
        </p>
        <p class="h5">Turbocharge productivity</p>
        <p>
          At one of our client sites, training new engineers necessitated the presence
          of experienced ones. Liten optimized this process by leveraging existing
          playbooks and cloud server datasets to refine the models. Additionally,
          it incorporated customer-specific prompt engineering to elicit expert,
          human-like responses from the Liten platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          A newly onboarded engineer could inquire about debugging status code errors,
          various log files, or inquire about the most significant issues from the
          past month and receive expert, human-like responses.
        </p>
        <p class="h5">Natural language-based reasoning</p>
        <p>
          Customers often feel hesitant about learning a new query language. The Liten
          platform addresses this concern by offering a natural language interface for
          query specification. Its code AI agent translates these specifications into SQL
          queries, enabling customers to use them seamlessly. Moreover, the platform
          integrates sophisticated visualization tools, empowering users to create and
          visualize cloud-based dashboards effortlessly. All these functionalities are
          orchestrated through a master agent, accessible via a unified natural language
          interface.

        <p id="usecase_bigdata" class="h4 text-center">Accelerated Big Data Observation</p>
        <p>
          Modern enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented surge in data creation, where vast
          amounts of information are generated constantly. This expansion coincides with significant
          advances in cloud technology, marked by disaggregated systems. While there are significant
          and continuous hardware advancements, the organizations struggle to meet the ever increasing
          demands for performance improvements, reduction in cycle times and to save on computational
          and cloud costs. The organizations are also in a race to combat climate change and meet
          their sustainability targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employing a unique tensor representation, the data agents within Liten AI can accelerate
          the queries by a huge multiplication factor of 50-100x thus helping the organizations
          achieve the twin goals of performance with sustainable computing while also saving
          costs in a competitive environment.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="h5">Accelerating Data Agent by 100x</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/data-agent.png" alt="Liten Data Agent">
        <p>
          Current relational and tabular data platforms lack adaptation to leverage emerging
          technologies. Employing a unique tensor representation, the data agents within Liten
          accelerate queries by a factor of 100. They transform incoming data into a
          tensor-formatted columnar structure, optimizing processor and accelerated solutions
          to enhance the speed of existing queries. Liten seamlessly integrates into Spark
          clusters and can efficiently ingest data from various data warehouses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h5">Benchmark TPCH  Query</p>
        <p>
          The Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) sets industry-standard benchmarks
          for data and query performance. TPC BenchmarkTM H is a decision support benchmark.
          Benchmark tests are conducted for Query 5 and Query 6 of TPCH because they have
          complex joins and result in longer query plans. These tests involved utilizing
          both a standalone Spark cluster and a separate Liten service. Liten enhanced query
          performance through a tensor-based engine and preserved an in-memory cache of
          tensors to eliminate redundant creation processes.
        </p>
        <p class="h6">TPCH Query 5</p>
        <p>
          This query compiles the revenue generated from local suppliers.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/tpch-query5.png" alt="Liten TPCH Query5">
        <p>
          Liten expedites this process by eliminating the necessity for joins. Instead, tensor
          data replaces joins with more straightforward multi-dimensional lookups. This
          streamlines operations by minimizing shuffle operations, resulting in a significant
          acceleration of the query.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accompanying diagram illustrates the plan and showcases Liten's handling of
          this process.
        </p>
        <p class="h6">TPCH Query 6</p>
        <p>
          This query assesses the potential revenue growth achievable by removing company-wide
          discounts.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/tpch-query6.png" alt="Liten TPCH Query6">
        <p>
          Liten notably streamlines the query plan, as illustrated in the diagram below.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Liten, the query plan is simplified along with accelerated scan/aggregates. On a
          standard Azure DS2 VM, Spark 3.2 required 16 seconds to execute, whereas Liten
          completed the task in a mere 0.06 seconds, delivering over a 100x performance
          improvement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h5">Customer Scenarios</p>
        <p>
          Liten seamlessly operates within existing or new SparkTM clusters as a service.
          Once activated, it utilizes jar files in Spark tasks to perform accelerated functions
          through Liten. Jobs executed by customers maintain their settings but experience
          enhanced performance. Liten accelerates various  tasks such as filters and joins,
          typically found in commonly used SQL query plans. Additionally, Liten can construct
          customized accelerated UDFs (User Defined Functions) tailored to individual customer
          requirements. These UDFs can be applied within queries or used as standalone functions,
          offering valuable solutions for specific customer use cases.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h6">
          Sample customer use case for cloud data analysis
        </p>
        <p>
          One of our clients hosts extensive network traffic data in the cloud, reaching
          volumes that can span into petabytes. To address company needs and inquiries,
          they regularly query these files to detect policy violations. However, this process
          became notably slow, hindering their ability to meet service level requirements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h7">Cloud Data Lake</p>
        <p>
          Liten offers a big data solution capable of storing limitless log data. It employs
          industry-standard open data lake format delta-lake for data storage. Specifically,
          in this scenario, data is stored in partitions categorized by traffic timestamps.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="h7">Accelerated Queries</p>
        <p>
          To tackle this, Liten incorporates an acceleration layer by storing data in a
          tensor-formatted file. This diminishes the necessity for cross-referencing and
          joining with additional data dimensions. As a result, Liten expedited the customer's
          query, delivering the sought-after policy answers promptly.
