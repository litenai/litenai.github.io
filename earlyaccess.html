      <div class="feature-container">
        <p class="h6 text-center">INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p class="text-white text-center">
          LitenAI is an AI engineer automating technical support and debug.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center">
          LitenAI platform orchestrates customized AI agents based on user
          prompt to observe, reason and visualize data at petabyte scale.
          Through its data layer, it can connect to external sources or
          ingest structured data, logs, and metrics. It also integrates
          customer knowledge bases from text, PDFs, HTML, and other media
          formats, using this information to deliver in-depth, contextually
          relevant insights drawn from both the data lake and securely
          integrated knowledge sources. By shifting technical support
          to an AI-first model, LitenAI reduces response times to critical
          issues by up to 100x, effectively bypassing traditional
          engineering bottlenecks.

        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center">
          Now available in early access, LitenAI can be deployed on public
          clouds with pre-configured agent workflows and data lakes. Users
          can evaluate its capabilities by uploading their data, or they
          can run it as a Docker image within secure data networks. To join
          the early access program or learn more, please
          <a href="index.html#about" class="link-teal"> contact us.</a>

          <br><a href="index.html#about" class="link-teal">Contact us</a> to get the
          latest docker image.
          <br>Once downloaded follow the following directions to run it locally.
          All data is local and accessible only to the user. LitenAI does not
          collect any data from user.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure that docker is installed and daemon running. USER
              should also be in the docker group. Follow the directions from
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository">docker website.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Load the image from the downloaded image.For this load the image as shown below.
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/load">Click here for more details.</a>
              <br><code>docker load < litenai.v0.0.81.tar.gz</code><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              The image should now be in docker images. This should show
              LitenAI image and tag.
              <br><code>docker image ls</code><br>
              Pick the litenai tag version that you want to run.
            </li>
          </ul>
          LitenAI agents can be used for technical support or debug from
          application logs or from equipment logs from the field. We show the
          two use cases below.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-container">
        <p class="h6 text-center">STARTING LITENAI SERVICE</p>
        <p class="text-white">
          To run the docker to analyze application logs set OpenAI API Key variable.
          Set API key to a valid OpenAI API key if using OpenAI. Set it to the API
          key if a local install is being used. It should be OpenAI API compatible.
          <br><code>export LITENAI_API_KEY="api_key"</code>
          <br>Now you can run the docker command for log reasoning.
          Replace the version with the correct tag.
          <br><code> docker run -d --rm --name litenai_container -p 8080:8080 -p 8210:8210 -p 8221:8221 -e LITENAI_API_KEY=${LITENAI_API_KEY} litenai/litenai:0.0.81 </code>
          <br>It takes a few minutes for LitenAI service to start. See below for some
          sample log reason chats. In the chatbot, in the side panel, you would also
          see saved chats.
          You can double click on them to load and see. You can chat with LitenAI as you
          would with a support and debug engineer.
          From the browser, you can open this location and start using the LitenAI.
          localhost may need to replaced with the url location needed for your machine.
          <br><code>http://localhost:8210</code>
          <br>It will ask for login credentials.
          Please <a href="index.html#about" class="link-teal"> contact us </a>
          to get the login credentials.

          <br>LitenAI agents can be tuned to customer requirements. By default, the docker
          file provides a local lake with AI agents tuned for application log reasoning.
          For log reasoning you dont need to set these variables.
          However, if you wish to try out the mode for debug assistance for field equipments
          such as medical devices, LitenAI provides an agentic onfiguration with sample
          lake tuned to assist field technicians providing technical support for medical
          and industrial device. If you wish to use in this techassist mode,
          please use the following docker run command.
          <br><code>docker run -d --rm --name liten_container -p 8080:8080 -p 8210:8210 -p 8221:8221 -e LITENAI_API_KEY=${LITENAI_API_KEY} -e LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE="techassist" -e LITENAI_LAKE_URL="/srv/lake/techassist" litenai/litenai:0.0.81</code>
          <br>These agentic modes are data driven configurations and can be tuned to customer
          specifications.
          
          <br>LitenAI can also use locally served LLMs. We also provide pre-built
          images to serve in customer networks. We can help with deploying and serving
          LLMs of interest. If being served locally, the url to be used for LLM call and
          LLM Model being used are needed. LitenAI uses an OpenAI API calls for all LLMs.
          An example setting is shown below.
          <br><code>export LITENAI_SERVE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"</code>
          <br><code>export LITENAI_LLM_MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct"</code>
          <br>This is the docker run command. You can use docker environment variables to
          use the correct run modes.
          <br><code>docker run -d --rm --name liten_container -p 8080:8080 -p 8210:8210 -p 8221:8221 -e LITENAI_API_KEY=${LITENAI_API_KEY} -e LITENAI_SERVE_URL=${LITENAI_SERVE_URL} -e LITENAI_LLM_MODEL=${LITENAI_LLM_MODEL} -e LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE=${LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE} -e LITENAI_LAKE_URL=${LITENAI_LAKE_URL} litenai/litenai:0.0.81</code>

          You can follow the following chat script to understand the agents and lake.
          The lake contains ingested documents as well as tables. User prompts are underlined in the text below.
          <br>Let us list the tables and understand the table we would be working on.
          <br><u>List all the tables.</u>
          <br><u>Describe imapserverlog and webaccesslog tables.</u>
          <br><u>Count the number of rows in imapserverlog and webaccesslog tables.</u>
          <br>Ask for the plan here to debug highest latency values.
          <br><u>Can you give me a plan to debug high latency value? Latency is measured
          by timestamp difference from imapserverlog to webaccesslog table. These tables
          are joined by requestid fields. Keep all the fields of both the tables in the
          output with names prepended with table abbreviations. Give me the SQL
          selecting highest 500 latency values.</u>
          <br>Now you can execute the generated SQL.
          <br><u>execute the generated sql</u>
          <br>Ask for an analysis.
          <br><u>Can you analyze the possible causes of high latency?</u>
          <br>Drill down for a specific error code.
          <br><u>I want to focus on status code. Could you modify the sql to select
          all rows with the status codes indicating error like 404, 500 etc.</u>
          <br><u>Execute the sql now.</u>
          <br>Look at the plot. It gives a data explorer on the output dataset.
          <br><u>Plot the data.</u>
          <br>You can also serve the plot on a different tab for better view.
          <br><u>serve the plot.</u>
          <br>Now ask for top error.
          <br><u>Can you tell me one top error code for latency degradation? Limit your selection to one error code.</u>
          <br>Ask for resolution.
          <br><u>Looks like 500 is the real problem. Suggest some resolutions for this.</u>
          <br>You can ask for more plans and drill down further as needed.

        <p class="text-white">
          To add unstructured data, such as PDFs, text, HTML, or other media files, select the tab named "Lake" from the main display. Choose the file under the heading:
          <br><code>Ingest unstructured data like PDF, text, HTML, etc.</code>
          <br>Click "Ingest." This will ingest all the data and index it with embeddings to enable semantic search as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow.
          <br>You can add your knowledge base, including PDF manuals, troubleshooting guidelines, standard operating procedures, etc. LitenAI agents then use this data to refine their responses. Note that none of this data is shared with Liten or LLM; it remains entirely within your customer lake.

          To add structured data from files containing logs or tables, first select the "Lake" tab from the main display. Refer to the following section:
          <br><code>Ingest CSV or JSON. Infer new structures from file and create table below.</code>
          <br>All ingested structured data will be appended to the selected table.
          <br>If a table with the same structure already exists, select it from the top. Choose the file. Supported file types are CSV or JSON. Select the options, then click "Ingest" to add the data to the tables. The "Chat" tab will show the response.
          <br>If a table matching the file structure does not exist, it must be created first. Select the table from the top; a sample JSON structure will appear in the section titled:
          <br><code>Table Structure</code><br>
          To infer this from the selected file, enter a unique table name below, then click "InferDesc." This will display the inferred table structure JSON above.
          Sometimes, timestamp columns are not inferred correctly. If timestamp data is important, you may need to add it manually. Use the following fields:
          <br><code>"timeseries": "timestamp", "timeseries_format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"</code>
          <br>Click the "Create" button.
          <br>If successful, this will add the table to the Table list and set it as the active table.
          <br>Now you can ingest the file by clicking the "Ingest" button below the "Ingest CSV" line.
          <br>Your structured logs are now added to the lake. These logs can be analyzed using LitenAI agents as described above. Try out your reasoning scenarios.
