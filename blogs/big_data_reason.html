      <p class="h2">Use Cases</p>
      <p>Here are a few use cases where Liten is able to help customers solve big data reasoning.</p>
      <p class="h3">Querying for policy violations from petabyte of data</p>
      <p>The customer hosts extensive network traffic data in the cloud, reaching potentially petabyte-scale volumes. As per their operational needs, they regularly query these files for potential policy breaches. However, this process faced significant slowdowns, hindering their ability to meet service level requirements.</p>
      <p class="h4">Cloud Data Lake</p>
      <p>Liten offers a comprehensive big data solution capable of storing limitless log data. Utilizing industry-standard open data lake formats, we organized the data into partitions based on traffic timestamps.</p>
      <p class="h4">Accelerated Queries</p>
      <p>Liten tackled this challenge by introducing an acceleration layer that stores data in a tensor-formatted file. This strategic approach minimizes the necessity for cross-referencing and joining data across multiple dimensions.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="h3">Co-pilot to turbocharge productivity</p>
      <p>At one of our client sites, training new engineers necessitated the presence of experienced ones. Liten optimized this process by leveraging existing playbooks and cloud server datasets to refine the models. Additionally, it incorporated customer-specific prompt engineering to elicit expert, human-like responses from the Liten platform.</p>
      <p>A newly onboarded engineer could inquire about debugging status code errors, various log files, or inquire about the most significant issues from the past month and receive expert, human-like responses.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="h4">Natural language-based reasoning</p>
      <p>Customers often feel hesitant about learning a new query language. The Liten platform addresses this concern by offering a natural language interface for query specification. Its code AI agent translates these specifications into SQL queries, enabling customers to use them seamlessly. Moreover, the platform integrates sophisticated visualization tools, empowering users to create and visualize cloud-based dashboards effortlessly. All these functionalities are orchestrated through a master agent, accessible via a unified natural language interface.</p>
      <p>Liten's models serve as invaluable aids to all cloud engineers—CIOs, SREs, DevOps engineers, and more—acting as co-pilots to significantly enhance productivity.</p>
      <br><br>
