      <br/>
      <p class="text-gray">
        LitenAI is an AI engineer automating technical support and debug.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray">
	It orchestrates LitenAI agents to observe, reason and visualize petabyte scales of data. Liten lake ingests structured data, logs or metrics to enable accelerated search through big data using python and SQL. It also ingests all customer knowledge from text, pdf,	html or other media files. This knowledge base is used by agents to provide unique insight from the securely integrated knowledge and structured data lake. LitenAI engineer left shifts technical support, and reduces response times to critical issues by 100x by removing engineering expertise bottlenecks. It is being evaluated by many companies.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray">
        Please <a href="mailto:hkverma@litenai.com" class="link-teal">contact us</a> for access to our docker install to try out early access program or for any other information.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="justify-content-center">DOCKER INSTALL DIRECTIONS</h3>
      <br/>
      <p class="text-gray">
	Please download the docker image from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kdZ26SC56GEpu-e1QyxxqyuyS8ritas/view?usp=drive_link">LitenAI store</a>. Once downloaded follow the following directions to run and test it locally. All data is local and accessible only to the user. LitenAI does not collect any data from this use.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-gray">
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Ensure that docker is installed and daemon running. USER should also be in the docker group. Follow the directions from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall">docker website</a><br>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Load the image from the downloaded image.For this do the following as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/load">shown here.</a><br>
	    <code>docker load < litenai.v0.0.78.tar.gz</code><br>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    To run the docker, you can set the following variables. <br>
	    Set API key to a valid OpenAI API key if using OpenAI. Set it to the API key if a local install is being used.<br>
            <code>export LITENAI_API_KEY="api_key"</code><br>
	    If being served locally, the url to be used for LLM call and LLM Model being used are needed. LitenAI supports many LLMs. We also have local LLM installation images, we can help with deploying and serving LLMs of interest. Set these only if local LLM serve is being used. An example setting is shown below.<br>
	    <code>export LITENAI_SERVE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"</code><br>
	    <code>export LITENAI_LLM_MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct"</code><br>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    LitenAI agents can be tuned to customer requirements. By default, the docker file provides a local lake with AI agents tuned for log reasoning. For this mode, you dont need to set these environment variables<br>
	    We also provide an agentic onfiguration with sample lake tuned to assist field technicians providing technical support for medical and industrial device. If you wish to use in this techassist mode, please set these variables.<br>
	    <code>LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE='techassist'</code><br>
	    <code>LITENAI_LAKE_URL='/srv/lake/techassist'</code><br>
	  </li>
	  <p class="text=gray">
	    Find the litenai tag version that you want to run. Tags can be seen by the following command.<br>
	    <code>docker image ls</code><br>
	    Now you can run the docker command. Replace the version with the correct tag. Use only those variables that you set up earlier.<br>
            <code> docker run -d --rm --name litenai_container -p 8080:8080 -p 8210:8210 -p 8220:8220 -e LITENAI_API_KEY=${LITENAI_API_KEY} -e LITENAI_SERVE_URL=${LITENAI_SERVE_URL} -e LITENAI_LLM_MODEL=${LITENAI_LLM_MODEL} -e LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE=${LITENAI_AGENTIC_MODE} -e LITENAI_LAKE_URL=${LITENAI_LAKE_URL} litenai/litenai:version </code><br>
	    The container will run after some time. From the browser, you can open this location and start using the code.<br>
	    <code>http://localhost:8210</code><br>
	    For login use, you can use user as 'guest' and password as 'password'<br>
	  </p>

      <h3 class="justify-content-center">LITENAI USE DIRECTIONS</h3>
      <br/>
      <h4 class="justify-content-center">EXAMPLE CHAT SESSION</h4>
      <br/>
      <p class="text-gray">
	You can follow the following chat script to understand the agents and lake. The lake contains ingested documents as well as tables. Prompts are shown in italics.<br>
	<ul>
	  Let us list the tables and understand the table we would be working on.<br>
	  <li><i>List all the tables</i></li>
	  <li><i>Describe imapserverlog and webaccesslog tables</i></li>
	  <li><i>Count the number of rows in imapserverlog and webaccesslog tables.</i></li>
	  Ask for the plan here to debug highest latency values.<br>
	<li><i>Can you give me a plan to debug high latency value? Latency is measured by timestamp difference from imapserverlog to webaccesslog table. These tables are joined by requestid fields. Keep all the fields of both the tables in the output with names prepended with table abbreviations. Give me the SQL selecting highest 500 latency values.</i></li>
	Now you can execute the generated SQL<br>
	<li><i>execute the generated sql</i></li>
	Ask for an analysis.<br>
	<li><i>Can you analyze the possible causes of high latency?</i></li>
	Drill down for a specific error code.<br>
	<li><i>I want to focus on status code. Could you modify the sql to select all rows with the status codes indicating error like 404, 500 etc.</i></li>
	execute the sql now.<br>
	<li><i>execute the sql</i></li>
	You can look at the plot. It gives a data explorer on the output dataset.<br>
	<li><i>plot the data</i></li>
	You can also serve the plot on a different tab for better view<br>
	<li><i>serve the plot</i></li>
	You can ask for top error<br>
	<li><i>Can you tell me one top error code for latency degradation? Limit your selection to one error code.</i></li>
	Ask for resolution.<br>
	<li><i>Looks like 500 is the real problem. Suggest some resolutions for this.</li>
	You can ask for more plans and drill down further as needed.</i><br>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="justify-content-center">INGEST UNSTRUCTURED DATA</h3>
      <br/>
      <p class="text-gray">
	To add unstructured data like pdf, text, html, or any other media files, pick the tab named 'Lake' from main display. Pick the file under the heading<br>
	<code>Ingest unstructured data like pdf, text, html etc.</code><br>
	Click on ingest. It ingests all the data and indexes with embeddings to enable semantic search as well RAG (retreival augmented generation) flow.<br>
	You can add all your knowledge including pdf manuals, trouble shooting guidelines, standard operating procedures etc. LitenAI agents tune their response using this data. Note that none of this is shared with Liten or LLM, it all sits within customer lake.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="justify-content-center">INGEST STRUCTURED DATA</h3>
      <p class="text-gray">
	To add structured data from files containing structured logs or other tables, first pick the tab named 'Lake' from main display. Look at the following section.<br>
	<code>Ingest csv or json. Infer new structures from file, and create table below.</code><br>
	All ingested structured data get appended to selected table.<br>
	If a table with that structure, already exists, pick the table from top. Choose the file. Supported file types are csv or json. Pick the options and then Ingest. It would add the data to the tables. 'Chat' tab shows the response.<br>
	If a table with file structure does not exist, it should first be created. Piick the table from top, it would show a sample json structure in the section titled.<br>
	<code>Table Structure</code><br>
	To infer this from the selected file, enter a unique table name below this, and click on InferDesc. It shows the table structure json inferred above. Sometimes, the timestamp columns are not inferred properly. You may want to add this manually if timestamp is of importance. The fields are following<br>
	<code>  "timeseries": "timestamp", "timeseries_format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"</code></br>
	Click on create button<br>
	If successful, it would add it to be Table list and select it as an active table.<br>
	Now you can ingest the file by clicking on ingest button below the Ingest csv line.<br>
	Now you have added your structured logs to lake. This log can be reasoned our using LitenAI agents described above. Please go ahead and try out your reasoning scenarios.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="justify-content-center">CONNECT TO YOUR DATA SOURCE</h3>
      <br/>
      <p class="text-gray">
	LitenAI can read or stream data from existing data sources. It does not needs to be ingested in Liten lake. Please contact us to know how we can ingest your data sources.<br>
